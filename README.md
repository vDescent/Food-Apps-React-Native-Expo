## Things that i learned
- Clean code is important, after finishing this project i look at my code again, and "well clean code is important" 
- I wish i use github sooner at this project to track future changes

Package manager that i used (need to install manually) : 
- npx install firebase
- npx install react-native-maps

> To run this project 
download -> extract -> open in VSCode -> open terminal (don't use powershell because some of expo commands cannot run in powershell, so just in case) -> install 
- npx install firebase
- npx install react-native-maps
- and then run npx expo run 

# IMPORTANT 

This project using expo go SDK 52, some features might not run run smoothly yet especially the Supermarket.tsx
